My primary research interests are in the fields of **computer vision and machine learning**. I work on **weakly-supervised models** to learn discriminative regions to perform robust image categorization (object recognition, scene classification, action classification). I am interested in the **Multiple Instance Learning** (MIL) approach with **Latent Structural SVM** (LSSVM) model.
