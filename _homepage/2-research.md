I am working at the [Pierre and Marie Curie University](http://upmc.fr/) in Paris, at the [LIP6 lab](http://www.lip6.fr/), in the [MLIA team](http://www.lip6.fr/recherche/team.php?id=530) managed by [Patrick Gallinari](http://www-connex.lip6.fr/~gallinar/) and under the supervision of [Matthieu Cord](http://webia.lip6.fr/~cord/) and [Nicolas Thome](http://webia.lip6.fr/~thomen/). Matthieu Cord's team is focusing on Computer Vision research and is of course taking the deep learning turn.

My research interests are broad and goes from _supervised deep learning for image classification_ to _semantic representation learning for text and images_ and _deep recurrent neural networks_. But currently, I am focusing on **semi-supervised learning for image classification** and **generative models of images (VAE, GAN, RBM, etc.)**.
