## Abstract

We introduce a novel framework for **WEakly supervised Learning of Deep cOnvolutional neural Networks (WELDON)**. Our method is dedicated to automatically **selecting relevant image regions** from weak annotations, e.g. global image labels, and encompasses the following contributions. Firstly, WELDON leverages recent improvements on the Multiple Instance Learning paradigm, i.e. **negative evidence** scoring and **top instance selection**. Secondly, the deep CNN is trained to **optimize Average Precision**, and fine-tuned on the target dataset with efficient computations due to convolutional feature sharing. A thorough experimental validation shows that WELDON outperforms state-of-the-art results on six different datasets.
